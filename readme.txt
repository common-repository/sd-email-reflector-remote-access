An API for <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/threewp-email-reflector/">ThreeWP Email Reflector</a> enabling remote access / administration capabilities.

== Description ==

The plugin allows external sites to interact with <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/threewp-email-reflector/">ThreeWP Email Reflector</a>.

Programmers can use the `SD_Email_Reflector_Remote_Access_Call.php` class to send calls to Email Reflector. Documentation and examples for using the the Remote Access Call class is embedded in the class source file.

Unless you're a programmer, or have set up other sites with the API, then this plugin will do nothing useful.
